HNG Intern Competition Solution: Question 1

To setup:

1. clone repo 
2. put in your server folder (local or remote)
3. navigate with your browser to the folder location

How it works:

1. It goes to your timeline and fetch every recent tweets (past 20 tweets)
2. Strips down the tweets and fetch out the video content
3. Present all video content to you

SO, if you see a video you like, just retweet it come back to the app 
And it will be listed then you download whichever format you like.


Thank you.
